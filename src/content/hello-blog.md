After years of procrastination, I'm doing the first step writing the very first post in my blog.

Looking back to my yearly resolutions I've planned to start a blog since 2014. It's time to start writing!

I'll write about code and travel. I'll try to share experiences of my daily life as a startup co-founder and digital nomad.

The goal is to organize, research and discuss ideas. I'm not waiting for any direct return.
I'm trying to get the well knew benefits from writing.

Don't expect to see beautiful writing and correct grammar. I'll not be sorry about that :P
